# Lab issues

## Exploring the lab environment

No DHCP on any virtual network other than INTERNET. IP address doesn't validate.

## Reviewing IoC and threat intelligence sources

Alienvault link returns no useable result. Try [https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/614e0dc583aa90bf2dd4ec91](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/614e0dc583aa90bf2dd4ec91). Obviously the first ip address will be different. Also, no IPv6 or HASH entries - whatev's

CIS benchmarks site no longer matches instructions

## Configuring centralised logging

Couldn't see any logs from MS10 - odd error message. No idea

If bash (linux shell) gets stuck in the wrong colour -

`echo -e "\033[0m"`
