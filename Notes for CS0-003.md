# Lab issues

## Exploring the lab environment

No DHCP on any virtual network other than INTERNET. IP address doesn't validate.

## Reviewing IoC and threat intelligence sources

Alienvault link returns no useable result. Try [https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/614e0dc583aa90bf2dd4ec91](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/614e0dc583aa90bf2dd4ec91). Obviously the first ip address will be different. Also, no IPv6 or HASH entries - whatev's

CIS benchmarks site no longer matches instructions

## Configuring centralised logging

Couldn't see any logs from MS10 - odd error message. No idea

If bash (linux shell) gets stuck in the wrong colour -

`echo -e "\033[0m"`

## Performing passive scanning

ICMP unreachables leaked thru filter?

## Establishing context awareness

Not sure why the lab considers kali unaffected by CVE-2021-4217

Email stuff - lots of *type to active machine* buttons instead of *copy text* buttons.

No copy marker for email header - manual select and copy..
